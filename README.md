HTML5_Android_Template
======================

A starting point for creating Android apps using HTML5 in Eclipse.

Create your HTML5 code, and copy the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files to the assets/www folder.

The default behavior is to load the 'assets/www/index.html' file in an Android WebView.  You can change this behavior
by modifying the Main.java file. ('src/com/jakewp11/template/Main.java')
